New York City Airbnb Analysis

Founded in August of 2008 in San Francisco, California. Airbnb is a trusted marketplace for people to discover and book unique accommodations around the world. People can book on mobile phone or on their computer and Airbnb provides every choice that people might have to give them the best experience ever. Furthermore, Airbnb connects travelers to diverse experience and different culture in over 34,000 cities and 190 countries (About Airbnb). However, there are voices saying that the way that people using Airbnb is disrupting the hotel industry and affecting the neighborhoods because more and more guests rent the entire home all year round. This dataset contains the listing activity metrics in New York City for 2019 and we want to discover more information about hosts and geographical availability. To simplify the problem, the prediction of the actual price will be conducted. At the same time, we will calculate the average price of all listings and convert it to two binary variables to examine which host set the price above the average or below for another approach. The purpose of the method will allow hosts to adjust their price based on the prediction.
